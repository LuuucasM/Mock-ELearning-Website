## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
I did this project in one of my school courses with a team of 6 or 7 people. I personally worked the back end coding.
## Motivation
For the African Impact Challenge our solution will be focused on building an Elearning Platform. We wish to create a simple user friendly elearning platform for african entrepreneurs. Our motivation for choosing this challenge was because we feel like it would be a good challenge for our skillset.

## Technologies Used
Front-End 

- Language: Typescript
- Framework: React Native

Backend

- Language: Python
- Framework: Django
- Database: Mongodb

## Installation

This installation guide will assume a windows environment 

To setup get started we will need 

- Node [download link](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Python [download link](https://www.python.org/)
- Mongodb [download link](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

After you install python and node you should automatically have `npm` and `pip` install. Run the following to ensure that you have them install on your computer

```
D:\foo\bar> npm -v
6.14.13
D:\foo\bar> py -m pip -V
pip 21.1.1 from ...
```

The project will utilize `pipenv` to manage backend python dependencies run the following to install it

```
D:\foo\bar> py -m pip install pipenv
```
To work with the front facing react native application we will need the expo-cli run the following to install it globally
```
D:\foo\bar> npm install -g expo-cli
```

Now we have the required technologies to build the project after you clone the repo run the following

```
py -m pipenv install
cd client
npm install
```
To activate the python virtual environment run `py -m pipenv shell`
To migrate all collections defined in the app to your local mongodb instance run `py manage.py migrate`
