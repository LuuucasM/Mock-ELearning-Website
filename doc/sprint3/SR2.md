### Unfinished Tasks

- Classroom views and backend some parts incomplete and not integrated
- Comment threads/posts frontend and backend completed, but no use for them as of yet
- Properly integrating all features from sprint 1

### Helpful Practices

- Communicating about major changes that can affect many components
- Documenting many of our needed REST API endpoints before we implement them, so we can work on front and backends separately 

### Harmful Practices

- Not finding large dependencies earlier, causing a lot of waiting
- Waiting until last minute for implementations

### Best/Worst Experience

- WORST: Incapacitated teammates due to COVID 2nd dose
- Better teammate bonding
- Much better understanding of the technologies
