### Unfinished Tasks

- All component front and backends work individually, however they have not been integrated together in a fully functional app
- Consistently styling frontend pages

### Helpful Practices

- Asking for help and having the more experienced developers help others learn the tech stack
- Regularly giving status updates on current tasks

### Harmful Practices

- Not communicating about ambiguities in tasks and overlap/coupling of user stories and tasks

### Best/Worst Experience

- Getting to know more people interested in my program that are interested in the same things, and learning new cutting edge technology
