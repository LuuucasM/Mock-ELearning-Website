### Scenarios ###

#### Entrepreneur ####

Suppose Emmanuel is a new graduate with a masters degree in management. He has a great idea for an app that can better organize the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in his community. He isn’t very familiar with mobile development, but joins E-AIC and is able to take a beginners course in Kotlin. He develops a basic prototype of his app, and again uses E-AIC to get in touch with a local pharmacy that is interested with developing the app further. Now Emmanuel has acquired the skills needed to begin working on his idea and look for other courses that can help further support its development.

#### Mentors ####

Suppose Chidi is a professor of business management at St. Johns University. He knows what a powerful tool IBM Watson is, and wishes for it to be accessible and easy to use for entrepreneurs in low-income countries. Chidi, along with some other professors, develop an online course detailing the basic use cases and functionality of IBM Watson. With approval of the African Impact Challenge, they upload the free course to E-AIC. Now Chidi has given entrepreneurs who use E-AIC a chance to use and learn Watson for free, as well as the opportunity to get expert advise from Chidi himself.

#### Partners/Investors ####

Suppose Jedidiah is an executive at Citadel in New York and is passionate about investing and supporting entrepreneurs in low-income countries. He browses E-AIC and discovers an entrepreneur who owns a construction company with an idea to build a new community centre that runs primarily on solar energy. The entrepreneur has his team assembled, he just needs some additional funding to start the project. Now Jedidiah is able to connect with the young entreprenuer to provide funding to help him start construction on his project, and could possibly support him with future opportunities.


### Principles ###
Focus on User Interface and User Experience principles to design for less “tech-savvy” users. Use the agile development process to build the best product possible with consultation from the African Impact Initiative partners. The main goal of the project should be to give entrepreneurs the resources and connections required to make impactful change in their communities.
