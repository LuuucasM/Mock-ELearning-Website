Team 8 - Processes and Procedures

I. Team Organization: 
Our team is organized as a non-hierarchical team without an assigned leadership position. All our members understand the goal of the project and the importance of contributing as fairly as possible. We have discussed the consequences of failing to deliver on our agreed upon responsibilities to ensure punctual project completion. Our team strives to continue moving forward with this organization while removing unnecessary frictions to increase our effectiveness.

II. Tools and Communications: 
In line with the course instructions, our team will be using Github for version control and Atlassian Jira for product backlog management. In addition, we have created a team Discord server to facilitate communication.

III. Decision-making: 
Decision-making in our team is generally consensus-based, where we allocate a time during the meeting to propose ideas and insights before finalizing a decision. We disagree and share ideas respectfully, and fully commit to any decision that has been made. So far, we have not had any disagreements that do not lead to consensus, but we plan to build a more robust decision-making process to anticipate future disagreements.

IV. User Stories Prioritization: 
TBD

V. Meetings: 
Our team has agreed on one all-hands meeting every week, conducted every Monday at 9PM Eastern Time. Each meeting will last about 1 hour starting with updates on weekly deliverables and ending with work division for the next week's deliverables. That being said, our team is open to additional meetings outside of the regular schedule to discuss completion and quality of deliverables closer to the sprint deadline.

VI. Moving Forward: 
Moving forward, our goal is to help every member of the team explore and learn new skills by choosing tools and technologies that each member is interested to dive deeper into while managing to complete the entire project stack. We also strive to improve our communication and development processes to further remove frictions and become more efficient.
